# matrix
very simple matrix library, int addition to a recreation of DCM attitude estimation in the form of matrix of C.
# intro
this repo comes from a part-time project. the matrix.c contains some basic matrix algorithm, it is not as huge as other classical library. may be useful in some situation. I collect and write such a library for the recreation of the DCM attitude estimation algorithm, of course, to translate matlab to c in matrix way.
